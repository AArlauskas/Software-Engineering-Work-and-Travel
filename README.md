# Introduction to Software Engineering project

## Work and Travel Emailer
Project for University of Aveiro.

## In the presentations folder, you can see a Demo video of the application

Emailing system created with an idea to help out students to participate in the program **"Work and Travel"**. 
The idea of project was to simplify the process of finding a job for the program by saving time and automating tasks required to find the best place to work at.
Emailing system contains a list of companies with real credentials from USA companies that have provided their credentials. This information is always up-to-date as it is being synchronized through Google Places API. 
Students can sign in into the system, create tasks (email sending) and automate the process of sending out emails. The amount of information provided to the user depends on the role that he has.
